## 👨‍💻 Sanjay Patidar – Full Stack Engineer (Case Study Portfolio)

I'm a software engineer who has built more than 12 full-scale, production-grade applications — many of which solve real business problems and operate under real-world constraints. Every project I build tells a story: from offline pain points to digital transformation, from bugs to breakthroughs.

---

## 🚀 My Engineering Journey (End-to-End)

From concept to deployment, here’s how I turned user needs into real, scalable software:

### 🧠 Thought Process
- Started by identifying real problems with LIC officers’ outreach, developer education gaps, and P2P communication friction.
- Designed tailored architecture for each challenge: SEO-first marketing sites, e-learning SaaS, event dashboards, and real-time chat systems.
- Maintained solo ownership — from architecture to devops — under deadlines, resource constraints, and iterative feedback.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What kind of SEO work have you done?</strong></summary>
  <p>SSR using Vite + React Helmet, schema.org, semantic HTML5, Open Graph, Sitemap.xml. I’ve ranked in top 3 on Google for “Neemuch Bima Yojana”.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Are these real paid collaborations?</strong></summary>
  <p>Yes. LIC Neemuch was a real collaboration (₹50K est.) with signed MOU. Zedemy is an independent SaaS build.</p>
</details>

<details>
